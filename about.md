Hi! My name is Kyle, and I've been playing video games as long as I can remember.

My love for gaming drove me to learn game development in college, but I realized that my true passion lied more in the analysis of games rather than their development.

Joypad Cinema is my attempt to explore the world of gaming, using my knowledge of the industry to break down the magic that goes into making games.
